# Unquenched Bible CLI
I'm attempting to throw together a quick Bible plan tracker using terminal/command prompt. I've always avoided because I was unsure how to handle automatic running of different parts needed, but I think if I create different files for automatic actions and run a first time set up function, I can set it to automate things such as checking to see if a list is done. 

I could also go an easier route, and just check date-time when first running the app to do what needs to be done, since the automation is all done at midnight each night. I could also set this up with specific times.
